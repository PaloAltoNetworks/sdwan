# Device Onboarding

This skillet captures one or more serial numbers and adds them as managed
devices to the Panorama configuration. There is no association to device-group
or template stack at this stage.

The remote NGFWs must also be configured with the Panorama ip address and
use of templates and device-groups enabled.

Once onboarded devices can be updated and licensed in preparation for the
SD-WAN onboarding.
