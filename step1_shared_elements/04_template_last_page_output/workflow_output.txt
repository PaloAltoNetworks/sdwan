Panorama initial configuration workflow is complete

reference template {{ sdwan_shared_template }} has been added to Panorama
along with device-group shared objects:

* link tags
* catch-all profiles and post-rule
* a shared application group
* traffic distribution profile
* predefined zones (zone-to-branch, zone-to-hub, zone-internal)
* security policy pre-rule allowing application bgp between sites

Added the {%- for item in member_pool %} {{ item }} {%- endfor %} subnet to SD-WAN VPN address pool

The next step is to run the workflow to add a new hub or branch site
