# IronSkillet Preload

This optional skillet loads the Panorama shared IronSkillet elements including
device hardening and security profiles/groups to be used in local policies.

Ensure that this skillet has access to the IronSkillet repository and branch
configuration elements. For applications like PanHandler this includes the 
import and checkout of the IronSkillet repo and branch panos_v10.0.
